## Comments

Sorry for second submission. Previous submission broke reverse dependencies in an unexpected way. Breakages now in `distr6` and `mlr3proba` are expected and patches are ready to fix them.

## Test Environments

On GitHub actions:

* windows-latest (R release)
* macOS-latest (R release)
* macOS-latest (R devel)
* ubuntu-latest (R release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
 Breakages in `distr6` and `mlr3proba` are expected and patches are ready to fix them.
