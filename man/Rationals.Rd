\title{Set of Rationals}
\value{
An R6 object of class Rationals.
}
\description{
The mathematical set of rational numbers.
}
\details{
The set of Rationals is defined as the set of numbers that can be written as a fraction
of two integers, i.e.
\deqn{Rationals = \{\frac{p}{q} | p,q \ \in \ Z\}}{Rationals = {p/q | p,q \epsilon Z}}
where \eqn{Z} is the set of integers.

The \link{contains} method does not work for the set of Rationals as it is notoriously
difficult/impossible to find an algorithm for determining if any given number is rational or not.
Furthermore, computers must truncate all irrational numbers to rational numbers.
