#' @description <%=(class)%> class for symbolic <%=(operation)%> of mathematical sets.
#'
#' @details
#' The purpose of this class is to provide a symbolic representation for the <%=operation%> of sets that
#' cannot be represented in a simpler class. Whilst this is not an abstract class, it is not recommended to construct
#' this class directly but via the set operation methods.
